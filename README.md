## Product features

### The Motivation for Development
The main problem that most busy parents with little kids have is that **they don't know what to feed their kids**. They know the important of meal planning. There are tons of free family meal planning templates they can find on Pinterest. However, they are too busy to sit down and plan a meal for the whole week. Most of all, One of the parents often has no clue what should the kids have for dinner. These parents just want something super easy, portable, and shareable. 

Wouldn't it be nice if someone (in this case, us as developers!) builds a meal plan generator that helps the user searchs and selects a recipe to a weekly meal planner, and be able to share it to other caregivers!
